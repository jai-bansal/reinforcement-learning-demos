It draws almost exclusively from Arthur Juliani's blog post series. The 1st post in the series is:   
https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0   

The series includes an associated repo: https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents   

This repo is essentially a modified and heavily commented version of the repo above.   
Note that these scripts use Tensorflow 1.x.
